# UVM_TestBench to Verify Combinational Adder Circuit
##                ............ Some of the Classes are hidden/made private for Code Exclusivity ..........                        
 Please find my Extensive Research and design of Resusable UVM Agent and Verification Plan. Here I have
 
## 1. Wrote testbench in UVM;

## 2. Understood and Implemented Configuration db in UVM;

## 3. Implemented strategies for implementation of UVM components such as Transaction, Generator, Sequencer, Monitor, Scoreboard, Environment, Test;

## 4. Used TLM ports for Communication between Driver , Sequencer, Monitor, Scoreboard;

## 5. Completed the Reporting Mechanism in UVM Usage of Virtual Interface
